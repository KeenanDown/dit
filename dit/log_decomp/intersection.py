    """
    Returns the shared information derived from the logarithmic decomposition
    shared between the groups of random variables in 'list_of_rv_groups'.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dist : dit.Distribution
        The distribution to be examined.
    list_of_rv_groups : list
        A list of lists, containing random variable groupings for computing shared information.
    order : int, string
        Default value is 2. If set to n, redundancy is computed using n-atom upper sets.
        If given as "even", then will be generated for all even n-atoms. Likewise for "odd".
    log_base : int, float
        The base of the logarithm used for computing information.

    Returns
    -------
    shared_information : float
        The information shared between the groups of variables.

    Examples
    --------
    To see what information X and Y redundantly give about Z, do [["X"], ["Y"], ["Z"]]
    For information they give together about Z, do [["X", "Y"], ["Z"]].
